## **GDP and life expectancy analysis**

### **1. Project description**
This project examines the relationship between life expectancy and GDP levels in different countries. Time series are used to analyze country data over several years.

### **2. Tools used**
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

### **3. Key findings**
- Life expectancy increases with GDP growth
- Countries with low GDP show lower life expectancy
- Grouping the data by country allows us to see clear trends between economic development and life expectancy

### **4. Visualization example (Life expectancy & GDP)**

- A scatter plot showing the relationship between life expectancy and GDP across different countries
- Countries are color-coded to distinguish them
- The plot highlights how higher GDP often correlates with longer life expectancy
